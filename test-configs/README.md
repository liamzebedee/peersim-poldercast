# Test configurations
As part of my paper "To what extent is PolderCast more effective as SCRIBE as a P2P publish-subscribe network design", I had to conduct multiple tests.

Here are the configurations:
 - topic subscription: testing subscription speed
 - topic publication: testing dissemination speed, hit ratio
 - network resilience: testing churn

Each tested at network sizes of 500, 1000, 5000, 10000.

Node subscriptions are constructed based on real-life Twitter subscription data.

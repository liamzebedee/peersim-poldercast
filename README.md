# PolderCast module for PeerSim
This project is an independent implementation of a [PeerSim](http://peersim.sourceforge.net) module for [PolderCast](http://acropolis.cs.vu.nl/~spyros/www/papers/PolderCast.pdf), an innovative P2P publish-subscribe network design from 2012 by V Setty, M van Steen, R Vitenberg and S Voulgaris.

I wrote this module for gathering empirical data on [a paper I wrote for my International Baccalaureate in 2014 which compares one of the first designs in this field (SCRIBE) with the state-of-the-art (PolderCast)](http://liamz.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Computer-Science-Extended-Essay_Liam-Edwards-Playne.pdf). This code is available under the terms of the GPL version 3, copyright Liam Edwards-Playne.

PeerSim can run cycle-based and event-based simulations
Network consists of Nodes
Each Node has a list of Protocols
Simulation is started by building the network by constructing one initial node (the prototype), constructing all of its protocols (prototypes) and then cloning it until the desired network size is reached
Initialisers are then run on each individual node/protocol
The network is then started, and Controls observe/modify stuff
